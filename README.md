The primes are found by dividing it by all known primes it has found and if its a round number it will not be a prime and not add it to the list and if it is a prime it will add it to the list.  
This is the time it takes to find 10,000 primes: 10 seconds. Time will differ per computer i have a pentium silver CPU so yours can be slower or faster.
